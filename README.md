# System Design Roadmap

This repo provides a comprehensive guide for the ones seeking knowledge on System Design.

I created this roadmap for my own studies and hope it might help you as well.

The plan was crafted considering you might invest 20 to 30 minutes for your daily studies, but always providing resources for you to go deeper into each topic.
